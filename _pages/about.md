I'm a third year PhD student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). My research interests include machine learning, Data Mining, Graph Neural Networks, Time Series Analysis, Foundation Models, and LLM-enhanced learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenzhong Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwz/) of DisLab Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://dislab.nju.edu.cn/), Nanjing University. I was advised by [Prof. Zhen Cui](https://vgg-ai.cn/teachers/CuiZhen/) from Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

You can find my CV here: [Xiaobin's CV](../assert/XiaobinHong_CV_en.pdf) (Till 7/2024).
